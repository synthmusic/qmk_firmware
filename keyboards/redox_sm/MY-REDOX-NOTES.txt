here is the order of operations for qmk

## fun facts:  
- tapping term is not tracked on a per key basis: if an alternate key w/ a term is pressed, it takes over the timer
- to tell the difference between tap and hold for LT types, check record->tap.count on key down, it'll be 0 for a hold

the setup for the left and right sides is now defined as a kb.  for initial setup on the left side, use the following commands:

```
qmk compile -kb redox_sm/left -km default
qmk flash -kb redox_sm/left -km default
```

generally it should be unnecessary to reflash the child side unless the hardware changes.


Now that the left side is flashed, you can flash the right side with the following commands:

```
qmk compile -kb redox_sm -km default
qmk flash -kb redox_sm -km default
```

any updates to the map can simply be reflashed to the right side, and there is a command combo (pok) to kick it into flash mode.
